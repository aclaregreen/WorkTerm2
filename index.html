            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my second Co-op work term report! My name is Andrew Clare-Green, and I am a 3rd-year Computer
                Science student at the University of Guelph. This report highlights my experiences and achievements
                during my second work term as a Scheduling Systems Support Co-op student at the University of Guelph.
                I will discuss my accomplishments, the skills I developed, and reflect on my learning goals.</p>

        <div id="About" class="page">
            <h3>About the Employer</h3>
            <p> The University of Guelph, located in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, is home to nearly 30,000 students, offering 94 undergraduate degrees, 48 graduate programs, and 6 associate degrees. The university was established on May 8th, 1964, following the merger of the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC), the Ontario Veterinary College, and the Macdonald Institute. Later that year, Wellington College was added, expanding the university's opportunities in arts and sciences</p>
            <p>During this term, I worked in the Scheduling Systems department, part of the Office of Registrarial Services.
                The department oversees course scheduling, exam timetables, and classroom allocations, ensuring smooth
                academic operations for the university.</p>

        <div id="Goals" class="page">
            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>At the start of my work term, I set a few key goals to focus on during my time as a Scheduling Systems Support Co-op student. As a third-year Computer Science student, I always seek opportunities to enhance my technical skills and apply what I’ve learned in a practical setting. I wanted to use this term to deepen my understanding of database management, improve organizational processes through automation, and build stronger collaboration skills while working in a professional environment.

            </p> <p>One of my main goals was to strengthen my technical skills by gaining more hands-on experience with tools like SQL and Infosilem. I aimed to get comfortable working with large datasets and learn how to debug and optimize queries to ensure the accuracy of scheduling data. I also wanted to focus on scripting and automation, as I knew these skills would allow me to make an impact by improving workflow efficiency. By the end of the term, I had successfully built and implemented Python scripts that automated repetitive tasks, which helped the department save time and reduce the chance of errors.</p>
        <p>Another goal I set for myself was to improve my organizational efficiency. I actively looked for tasks that could be optimized and worked on simplifying complex workflows to make them more efficient. This not only gave me the chance to apply my technical knowledge but also taught me how to evaluate processes critically and design solutions that aligned with the team’s needs.</p>
            <p>Finally, I wanted to work on developing stronger collaboration skills. Communication and teamwork was crucial to my role, especially when resolving scheduling conflicts or seeking solutions to technical problems we can into. I focused on explaining these technical issues clearly, both in written and verbal formats, to ensure everyone involved could understand and take appropriate action. These interactions helped me improve my ability to work with diverse teams and strengthened my confidence in professional settings.</p>
            <p>By setting and working toward these goals, I was able to grow both technically and professionally while contributing meaningfully to the Scheduling Systems department.</p>
